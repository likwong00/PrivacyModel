# PrivacyModel

2 main files to run:
 - `model.py`: main file that runs all the different models and saves a `.csv` file containing various metrics at different timesteps of the runs to its respective directory.
 - `evaluate.py`: aggregates and averages all the results (`.csv` files) and plots a graph on the specified metrics.
